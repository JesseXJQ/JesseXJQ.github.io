#  About this Site

- This website will contain the collcation of some useful and cool softwares or plugins. I would like to share the daily softwares and tools to you guys. It's not a kind of professional website but it will be more accessible for all.
- Also, I would post my personal experience summary of programming skills and knowledge.
- Technology is a kind of attitude to life. When we pay more attention to it, we will find out that technology is not unattaintable and it is the cornerstone of our current and future society. 



**The real Technology is that you can't feel the existence of Technology.**
